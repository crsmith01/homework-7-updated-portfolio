## User Story

```
AS A potential employee,
I WANT to create a deployed portfolio of work samples for potential employers to view
SO THAT THEY can review samples of my work and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position.
```


## Acceptance Criteria

These are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN they need to sample a potential employee's previous work
1. WHEN they load my portfolio,
    THEN they are presented with my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, my resume, and how to contact me.
2. WHEN they click one of the links in the navigation,
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
3. WHEN they click on the link to the section about my work,
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications.
4. WHEN they click on the images of the applications,
    THEN they are taken to that deployed application.
5. WHEN they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport.
```

```
